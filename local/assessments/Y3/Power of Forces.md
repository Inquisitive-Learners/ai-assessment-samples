## Stage 1 Science & Technology – Year 2  
### Summative Assessment: *Forces Around Us*  
*(15 questions – 20 marks — 45 – 60 minutes)*  

---

### Assessed NSW outcomes  
- **ST1-SCI-01** measures and describes changes in movement  
- **ST1-PQU-01** poses questions to investigate cause and effect  
- **ST1-DAT-01** collects, represents and uses data to identify patterns and relationships  

### Assessed content points (taken from Lessons 6280 – 6284)  
- Recognise that a force is a push or a pull  
- Pose questions and test the effects of forces on an object’s movement  
- Test how frictional forces affect moving objects  
- Test how the force of magnetism affects objects  
- Investigate how applied forces change the movement of traditional toys and tools used by Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander Peoples  
- Sequence simple and compound sentences, and use labelled diagrams and data to describe cause and effect  
- Use nouns, noun groups and verbs to create notes, annotations and labels to document observations  

### Materials required for students  
- Pencil, coloured pencils  
- 15 cm ruler  
- 1 small magnet (shared)  
- 1 metal paper clip (shared)

   a. An object moves towards you  b. **An object moves away from you** ✔️  c. An object changes colour  d. An object gets heavier  

2. **Which picture shows a pull?** (1 mark)  
   a. Child kicking a ball  b. Child sliding a book across a desk  c. **Child opening a drawer** ✔️  d. Child pressing a door-bell  

3. **When two magnets’ north poles are placed together they will …** (1 mark)  
   a. attract  b. **repel** ✔️  c. melt  d. make a sound  

4. **On which surface will a toy car roll the furthest if you use the same force?** (1 mark)

## Section B – Short-answer & diagrams (9 marks)

5. **Label the forces.** (2 marks)  
   Below is a picture of a girl pushing a trolley.  
   - Draw one arrow from the girl’s hands to the trolley to show the push. (1)  
   - Write the word **push** next to your arrow. (1)

6. **Cause and effect.** (1 mark)  
   Complete the sentence using *towards* or *away from*.  
   “When I pull the rope, the bucket moves __________ me.”  
   *Answer: **towards***  

7. **Friction words.** (1 mark)  
   Tick (✔️) one word that best describes a surface with strong friction.  

   ☐ smooth  ☑ **rough**  ☐ shiny  ☐ wet  

8. **Magnets at work.** (2 marks)  
   You test five classroom objects with a magnet; three are attracted.  
   a. What type of material are the attracted objects most likely made from? **__________** (iron / steel / nickel) (1)  
   b. Explain in one sentence *why* the wooden ruler did not move. (1)  
      *Sample:* “Wood is not a magnetic material, so the magnet cannot attract it.”

9. **Traditional spinning top.** (3 marks)  
   Look at the photo of a First Nations spinning top (teacher to project).  
   a. Circle the action that starts the top spinning: push pull **twist** ✔️ (1)  
   b. Draw two small arrows on the picture to show the push and pull parts of the twist. (1)  
   c. Describe in one compound sentence *how* the twist makes the top move. Use **because** or **and**. (1)  
      *Example:* “I twist the stick by pushing and pulling, **and** the spinning top turns fast.”

## Section C – Investigation & data (7 marks)

10. **Planning an investigation – Friction ramp.** (2 marks)  
    You have a ramp that can be covered with felt or aluminium foil. Write **one question** you could ask to find out which surface has more friction.  
    *Sample:* “Which surface, felt or foil, makes the block stop sooner?”  
    - Clear comparison (1)  
    - Mentions friction/stop/slow (1)

11. **Collecting data.** (2 marks)  

    | Surface | Distance (cm) |
    |---------|--------------:|
    | Foil    | 45            |
    | Felt    | 18            |

    a. Which surface had the weaker friction? **__________** (foil) (1)  
    b. What pattern do you notice? Write one sentence. (1)  
       *Sample:* “The block travelled further on the foil because the friction was weaker.”

12. **Non-contact force challenge.** (3 marks)  
    You placed a paper clip on a paper plate and moved it with a magnet held underneath.  
    a. Draw the plate from above and use a dotted arrow to show the paper clip’s path. (1)  
    b. Why did the paper clip move even though the magnet did not touch it? (1)  
       *Sample:* “The magnet’s magnetic force acted at a distance and attracted the paper clip.”  
    c. Write **yes** or **no**: *Can this force travel through thick steel?* _____ (No) (1)
