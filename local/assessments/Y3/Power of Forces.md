- A. Gravity acts equally on both balls  
- B. The heavier ball lands first  
- C. Air resistance is the same for both

### Short-Answer (1 mark each)

**Q11.** Give one example of a non-contact force.  
*Model answer:* Gravity / Magnetism / Electrostatic force

**Q12.** Explain why a bicycle stops more quickly on grass than on a smooth road.  
*Model answer:* Grass creates more friction with the tyres, slowing the bike faster.

**Q13.** You are testing which surface lets a toy car roll the furthest. Name **one** variable you would keep the same to make the test fair.  
*Model answer:* Same ramp height / Same toy car / Same starting point

**Q14.** How does adding wheels under a heavy box make it easier to move?  
*Model answer:* Wheels reduce friction between the box and the ground, so less force is needed.

**Q15.** Why does a magnet not attract a wooden ruler?  
*Model answer:* Wood is not a magnetic material, so magnetic forces do not act on it.
