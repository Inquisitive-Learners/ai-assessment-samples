# Cognitive Assessment Subsystem

## 1. Framework  
- Based on a simplified Bloom’s taxonomy:  
  - **Remember** (recall facts and terminology)  
  - **Understand** (explain ideas or concepts)  
  - **Apply/Analyse** (use information in new situations; interpret data; follow procedures)  
- “Scientific skills” questions are drawn from Apply/Analyse—pose, test, observe, record, interpret.

## 2. Question‐Level Descriptors  
| Level           | Focus                                                         | Marks       | Format                                           |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Remember (L1)   | identify, list, label, recognise                              | 1 each      | single‐best‐answer MCQ; short label/annotation    |
| Understand (L2) | describe in own words; compare; explain cause–effect          | 2 each      | MCQ with two‐step reasoning; short open response |
| Apply/Analyse (L3) | interpret data/diagrams; sequence events; record observations; test hypotheses; outline procedures | 1–2 each    | 1-mark MCQ; 1-mark short answer; 2-mark open answer |

## 3. Scientific Skills Allocation  
- **Total “skills” questions:** 3  
  - 2 × 1-mark questions (e.g. label parts of a diagram; record a single observation)  
  - 1 × 2-mark question (e.g. outline steps of a simple experiment)

## 4. Overall Distribution (15 questions, 20 marks)  
- **Remember:** 6 × 1 mark = 6 marks  
- **Understand:** 2 × 2 marks = 4 marks  
- **Apply/Analyse:**  
  - 5 × 1 mark = 5 marks  
  - 2 × 2 marks = 4 marks  

## 5. Cognitive Constraints Checklist  
- At least 2 understanding questions worth 2 marks each ✔  
- Scientific skills: 1 @ 2 marks, 2 @ 1 mark each ✔  
- Remaining questions sample across recall and application ✔  

## 6. Verbs and Prompts by Level  
- **Remember:** name, list, label, match, recognise  
- **Understand:** describe, explain, compare, summarise  
- **Apply/Analyse:** observe, record, interpret, outline, sequence, test, predict, design

# Question Construction Guidelines Subsystem

## 1. Alignment & Coverage  
- Map each item to a published outcome and content descriptor.  
- Ensure breadth: recall, conceptual, skills, application.

## 2. Language & Clarity  
- Use age-appropriate vocabulary and syntax.  
- Phrase stems positively; avoid negatives unless necessary.  
- Each question should ask one clear thing.

## 3. Multiple-Choice Items  
- 4 options (A–D); one correct only.  
- Plausible, homogeneous distractors.  
- Randomise correct‐answer positions.  
- Avoid “all of the above”/“none of the above.”

## 4. Short-Answer Items  
- Indicate required form/length (e.g. “In one sentence…”).  
- 1 mark = one point; 2 marks = two distinct points.  
- Encourage concise, specific answers.

## 5. Diagrams & Data  
- Label graphics clearly; refer in stem (“see diagram”).  
- Ensure tables/graphs are uncluttered and legible.

## 6. Marking & Feedback  
- Provide an answer key with model answers.  
- Break down multi-point items by element.  
- Use consistent numbering and formatting.

## 7. Layout & Formatting  
- Use clear headings (e.g. “Multiple-Choice (2 marks each)”).  
- Leave white space for student responses.  
- Number questions sequentially; sub-parts as a), b), etc.

# Key Information for the Assessment Subsystem

**Please confirm the following before drafting the paper:**

- **Year level & subject**  
- **Unit title & key inquiry question**  
- **Syllabus/outcome codes to assess**  
- **Specific content/topics** (with approximate weighting)  
- **Total marks**, **number of questions**, **time allowance**  
- **Question types desired** (e.g. MCQ 1-mark; MCQ 2-marks; short-answer)  
- **Special conditions** (e.g. calculator use; language support)  

Once confirmed, the full assessment paper can be produced—complete with aligned mark allocations, item‐to‐outcome mapping, and an answer key.
