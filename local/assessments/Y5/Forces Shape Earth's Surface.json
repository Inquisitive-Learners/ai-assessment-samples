          "content": "Unit: Forces Shape Earth’s Surface\nYear Level: Year 4\nLesson ID: 5887\nLesson Name: Exploring Earthquakes\nDuration: 100 minutes\nFocus Question: What might cause Earth’s surface to change quickly?\nKey Inquiry Question: How do natural forces shape the Earth’s surface?\n\nLesson Overview:\nIn this lesson, students investigate how sudden forces—specifically earthquakes—can rapidly alter Earth’s surface. They will: understand plate tectonics, model plate movements using a chocolate bar, analyse the 2024 Noto Peninsula earthquake, and practise writing cause–effect sentences using the conjunction “so.”\n\nCurriculum Outcomes:\n• ST2-PQU-01: Poses questions to create fair tests that investigate the effects of energy on living things and physical systems.\n• ST2-SCI-01: Uses information to investigate the solar system and the effects of energy on living, physical and geological systems.\n• EN2-CWT-02: Uses compound and complex sentences to sequence connected ideas into paragraphs when explaining cause and effect.\n\nLearning Intentions:\nStudents are learning to:\n- Describe how earthquakes can change the landscape.\n\nSuccess Criteria:\nBy the end of the lesson, students will:\n- Understand that the movement of tectonic plates causes earthquakes.\n- Model what happens to the land during an earthquake.\n- Use the causal connective “so” to describe the effect of an earthquake on the landscape.\n\nKey Vocabulary (Tier 2 & 3):\n- Tectonic plate\n- Epicentre\n- Landscape\n- Causal connective\n\nBackground Reading for Teachers:\nEarth’s crust is divided into giant, interacting slabs of rock called tectonic plates. These plates move slowly, driven by forces in Earth’s interior. When stress builds at plate boundaries or faults and is suddenly released, shock waves send energy through the crust, producing an earthquake and shaking the ground.\n\nMaterials:\n- Mini chocolate bars (Mars bar or similar), one per pair\n- Plastic knife\n- iPad or tablet (for recording slow-motion video)\n- Projector or screen for videos\n- Printed images (road cracks, tilted house, flooded buildings)\n- E-book or article on the Noto Peninsula earthquake (2024)\n- Article on Tohoku tsunami (2011)\n\nAssessment Guidance:\n• Formative: Observe students’ discussions and quiz responses to check understanding of earthquake causes.\n• Informal: Monitor pairs during the model-making activity to assess their ability to describe plate movements and use “so.”\n• Checkpoint: Review students’ completed cause–effect table for accurate use of “so” and correct identification of landscape changes.\n\nLesson Sequence:\n1. Introduction (5 min)\n   • Display the road-crack image. Ask: “What might cause Earth’s surface to change quickly?” Record ideas. Address misconceptions.\n\n2. Activity 1 – Global Earthquake Animation (5 min)\n   • Play “Forces Change Earth’s Surface: 120 Years of Earthquakes” without context. Students describe what they see and hypothesise the map’s meaning. Show three photos of earthquake damage; ask if these inform their hypotheses.\n\n3. Activity 2 – What Causes Earthquakes? (10 min)\n   • Explain the animation shows earthquakes from 2000–2021. Define “earthquake.”\n   • Watch “What Causes Earthquakes?” video. Complete a four-question multiple-choice quiz on plate movement and Australia’s seismic activity.\n\n4. Activity 3 – Mars Bar Plate Model (15 min)\n   • In pairs, model plate convergence using a halved Mars bar. Predict what will happen when halves meet. Gently push halves together; record slow-mo video. Complete the sentence: “The tectonic plates met so Earth’s crust ___.”\n\n5. Activity 4 – Defining Landscape (5 min)\n   • Introduce “landscape” (all natural or built features in an area). Students complete a quick interactive labeling local features.\n\n6. Activity 5 – Noto Peninsula Case Study (30 min)\n   • Read about the 2024 Noto Peninsula earthquake. Discuss:\n     – Which landscape features changed?\n     – Which change was worst and why?\n   • Introduce causal table: Cause / so / Effect. Complete three rows using examples from the case study.\n\n7. Activity 6 – Tsunami Extension (20 min)\n   • Replay the opening earthquake animation; focus on purple flashes. Ask: “What do these flashes show?” Explain tsunamis form when epicentres are offshore.\n   • Read the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami article. Discuss scale of landscape and human damage.\n\n8. Activity 7 – Government Aid Debate (15 min)\n   • Present the 2009 Samoa earthquake/tsunami case. Students debate whether Australia’s $10 million aid was justified. Each student must state their position and then articulate an opposing viewpoint.\n\nDifferentiation:\n• Green Circle (core): Activities 1–5. Essential for meeting learning intentions.\n• Blue Square (deeper): Activity 6. Extends understanding to secondary effects (tsunami).\n• Black Diamond (challenging): Activity 7. Encourages critical and creative thinking through debate.\n\nClosure (5 min):\n• Revisit focus question: “What might cause Earth’s surface to change quickly?” Summarise how plate movements cause rapid change and how we describe effects using “so.”\n\nHomework / Extension:\n• Research a local or historical earthquake event. Write three cause–effect sentences using “so.”",
