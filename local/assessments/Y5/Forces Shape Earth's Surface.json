Flowing rivers carry sand and pebbles that grind against rock surfaces, and as a result the rocks are worn down and become rounded. Strong winds also pick up tiny particles that chip away at rocks, so over time sharp edges become smoother. Additionally, plant roots grow into cracks and expand, due to which the rock splits and breaks into smaller pieces. These processes all slowly change Earth’s surface.",
