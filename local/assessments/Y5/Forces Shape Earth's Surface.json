Overview\nStudents investigate how volcanic eruptions both create and destroy landscapes. Through video, interactive sliders, hands-on modeling, eBook reading and historical case studies, they develop cause-and-effect explanations of volcanic processes and their impacts.\n\n2. Learning Outcomes\nScience: ST2-SCI-01 uses information to investigate geological systems.\nEnglish: EN2-CWT-02 uses compound/complex sentences to explain cause and effect.\n\n3. Learning Intentions\nStudents will learn to:\n- Describe the sequence of events in a volcanic eruption.\n- Explain how eruptions change and create landscapes.\n\n4. Success Criteria\nBy lesson end, students can:\n- Identify magma, lava and eruption stages.\n- Model a volcanic eruption and observe landscape changes.\n- Write sentences using causal connectives to explain knock-on effects of eruptions.\n\n5. Materials\n- Projector/screen for video and interactive\n- Baking trays or shallow containers, modeling clay, sand/soil, plastic figures, blocks, jar, vinegar, baking soda\n- Copies of The Power of Volcanoes eBook\n- Pompeii artefact tables\n- Access to online solar system volcano resource\n\n6. Vocabulary\nTier 2/3: magma, lava, eruption, chamber, knock-on effect, causal connective\n\n7. 5E Lesson Sequence\n\nEngage (10 min)\n- Display volcanic landscape image. Ask: “Do volcanoes create or destroy?”\n- Record students’ ideas; address misconceptions.\n\nExplore (10 min)\nActivity 1: Watch eruption video. Discuss sensory impressions (sight, sound, smell, touch).\nActivity 2: Interactive slider—identify magma chamber, lava, eruption. MCQ on definition of lava.\n\nExplain (25 min)\nActivity 3: In groups, build a clay volcano around a jar on a tray with landscape features and figures. Predict eruption outcome, then add vinegar to baking soda. Observe and describe landscape changes. Use prompts to guide “As a result of the eruption, the landscape ….”\n\nElaborate (15 min)\nActivity 4: Read The Power of Volcanoes eBook. Discuss positive/negative effects: “Which surprised you?”, “Which is best/worst?”\n\nEvaluate (40 min)\nActivity 5 (25 min): Complete table of immediate landscape changes and knock-on effects. Use causal connectives (“Because…, the result is…”). Informal assessment checkpoint.\nActivity 6 (15 min): Pompeii case study. Complete table of discoveries and inferences about Roman life. Deep learning (Blue Square).\nExtension (20 min): Activity 7 (Black Diamond): Research volcanoes on other planets. Use causal connective “because” to justify which is most interesting, recording thinking in a flow chart.\n\n8. Differentiation\nGreen Circle: Core activities 1–5; accessible support through guided questions and sentence starters.\nBlue Square: Activity 6; deeper historical inference.\nBlack Diamond: Activity 7; open-ended research and justification.\n\n9. Assessment\nFormative: observation of group discussions, model explanations, table completions; written sentences using causal connectives.\nSummative: Informal checkpoint at end of Activity 5; evaluate clarity of cause-effect writing.\n\n10.
