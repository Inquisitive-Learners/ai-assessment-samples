          "content": "Weathering changes rocks gradually over time due to natural forces. For example, wind picks up fine particles of sand so that, as these particles are blown against rock surfaces repeatedly, the rock becomes smoother. Moving water also contributes to weathering because flowing rivers carry sediment that grinds down rock edges, and as a result, sharp corners become rounded. Plants can force rocks apart when roots grow into small cracks, and due to this pressure, the rock eventually splits into smaller pieces. Together, these agents of weathering reshape Earth's surface slowly but surely.",
