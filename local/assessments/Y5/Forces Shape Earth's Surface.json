Teacher Background\n• Earth’s crust = tectonic plates; they grind, pull apart or collide under Earth.  \n• Tension release along faults produces shock waves—earthquakes.  \n• 2024 Noto Peninsula quake raised coastlines, cracked roads, toppled buildings.  \n\n2. Learning Intentions & Success Criteria\nLearning Intentions:\n- Describe how earthquakes change landscapes.  \n- Model plate movements.  \n- Use “so” as a causal connective in sentences.  \nSuccess Criteria:\n- I can explain that plate movement causes earthquakes.  \n- I can show how crust deforms in my Mars bar model.  \n- I can write a sentence using “so” to link cause and effect.  \n\n3. Key Vocabulary\nTier 2: tension, sudden, violent\nTier 3: tectonic plate, fault, epicentre, crust, landscape, tsunami\nDefinitions displayed and referred to in every activity.  \n\n4. Materials & Safety\n• iPad or device for video/quizzes  \n• Projector/screen  \n• Mini Mars bars (1 per pair), plastic serrated knives  \n• Student journals, pencils  \n• Printed images and information sheets  \nSafety: supervise knife use; plastic only. Remind students not to eat model bars until end.  \n\n5. 5E Lesson Sequence\n\nENGAGE (10 min)\n• Show photo: road cracked by earthquake. Ask “What might cause Earth’s surface to change quickly?” Record ideas.\n• Play 120-Year Earthquake heat-map animation (no commentary).\n• Q: “Describe what you see. What might the map represent?” Accept all.  \n\nEXPLORE (25 min)\nActivity 1 (5 min)\n• Show three photos of quake damage. Ask how these relate to the animation.  \n• Reveal video theme: global quakes 2000–2021.  \n\nActivity 2 (10 min)\n• Students watch “What Causes Earthquakes?” video.  \n• Quiz (multiple choice) on definition of earthquake, tectonic plates, cause of quakes, Australia’s seismicity.\n• Check answers as a class; address misconceptions.  \n\nActivity 3 (10 min)\n• Pairs model plate collision: cut Mars bar, predict, then gently push halves.\n• Record slow-motion video of crust crumpling and cracking.  \n• Each pair completes: “The tectonic plates met so Earth’s crust ___.”  \nSample: “…buckled and cracked along a fault line.”  \n\nEXPLAIN (35 min)\nActivity 4 (5 min)\n• Define “landscape” = natural or built features in an area. Quick interactive matching terms→images.  \n\nActivity 5 (30 min)\n• Read e-book on 2024 Noto Peninsula quake.  \nDiscussion:\n- “Which landscape features changed?” (coastline rose, buildings collapsed, roads fractured)\n- “Which change was worst? Why?”  \n• Causal connective table: cause (“The earthquake struck”), connective (“so”), effect. Students complete 3 rows.  \nSample row: “The earthquake struck so the coastline shifted upward by 1.2 m.”  \n\nELABORATE (20 min)\nActivity 6 (20 min)\n• Replay opening animation, focus on purple flashes. Elicit: “What do they show?” (ocean quakes → tsunamis).\n• Read article on 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami.  \n• Discuss difference between regular waves and tsunami.  \n\nActivity 7 (Black Diamond) (15 min)\n• Case study: 2009 Samoa quake & tsunami; Australia’s $10 M aid.  \nTask: “Was this the right decision? Explain your view and anticipate an opposing view.”  \n\nEVALUATE (5 min)\n• Return to focus question and informal exit ticket: “Write one sentence using ‘so’ to explain how an earthquake changes the landscape.”  \n• Collect journals; read samples to gauge understanding and correct usage of “so.”  \n\n6. Differentiation\nGreen Circle (core)\n• Activities 1–5 and sentence writing with “so.”  \nBlue Square (deeper)\n• Activity 6: link quakes → tsunamis; difference in wave formation.  \nBlack Diamond (challenging)\n• Activity 7: ethical debate and perspective taking; extended writing.  \n\n7. Assessment & Feedback\n• Check quiz responses in Activity 2.  \n• Observe Mars bar models & video descriptions.  \n• Review completed causal tables.  \n• Exit tickets: assess correct use of “so” and accurate effect descriptions.  \n• Use informal questioning throughout to address misconceptions.  \n\n8. Practical Tips\n• Pre-cut Mars bars for safety if needed.  \n• Encourage descriptive language during discussion (crumple, uplift, fault).  \n• Circulate and support pairs during model activity.  \n• Use visual prompts for tiered activities; track timing with visible clock.  \n\n",
