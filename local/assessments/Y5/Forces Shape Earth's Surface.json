LESSON OVERVIEW\n- Year: 4   |  Lesson ID: 5917   |  Duration: 100 minutes\n- Lesson name: Volcano Power!\n- Focus question: Do volcanoes create or destroy?\n- Learning intention: Describe how volcanic eruptions change the landscape.\n- Success criteria:\n  • Identify what happens during a volcanic eruption.\n  • Model the effect of an eruption on the landscape.\n  • Write compound/complex sentences explaining cause & effect of landscape change.\n- Syllabus links:\n  NSW ST2-SCI-01: uses information to investigate the effects of energy on physical/geological systems\n  EN2-CWT-02: creating written texts using compound & complex sentences\n\n2. TEACHER READING NOTES\n- A volcano: opening in Earth’s crust allowing magma, gases & ash to escape.\n- Magma vs lava: molten rock underground vs at the surface.\n- Plate tectonics: most volcanoes at plate boundaries (divergent/convergent).\n- Eruptions can destroy (bury, devastate) but also build (new land, fertile soil).\n- Key Tier 2/3 vocabulary: magma chamber, lava, eruption, ash, fertile soil, tectonic plates.\n\n3. RESOURCES & MATERIALS\n- Multimedia: eruption video, interactive slider, “The Power of Volcanoes” eBook, device/internet\n- Hands-on: baking trays or shallow containers; modelling clay; jar; sand/soil; baking soda; vinegar; plastic figures/animals; building blocks\n- Worksheets: prediction & observation sheets, effects & knock-on effects table, Pompeii artifact table, Justification Flow Chart\n\n4. 5E LESSON SEQUENCE\nENGAGE (5 min)\n- Display volcanic landscape image. Ask: “Do volcanoes create or destroy?”\n- Record ideas; note misconceptions.\n\nEXPLORE (10 min)\nActivity 1 (5 min): Watch eruption video. Prompt: “What do you see, smell, hear, feel?”\nActivity 2 (5 min): Interactive slider to reveal “magma chamber,” “lava,” “eruption.” MCQ: definition of lava.\n\nEXPLAIN (65 min)\nActivity 3 (25 min): Build & erupt a clay volcano model.\n  • Predict outcome of adding vinegar to baking soda.\n  • Observe flow (lava) reshaping landscape & impacting figures/buildings.\n  • Record causal sentences: “As a result of…, the landscape…”\nActivity 4 (15 min): Read eBook “The Power of Volcanoes.” Discuss positive vs negative effects.\nActivity 5 (25 min): Complete table linking immediate landscape changes to knock-on effects using causal connectives (Because…, Therefore…).  Informal checkpoint on understanding.\n\nELABORATE (35 min)\nActivity 6 (15 min): Pompeii case study. Complete artifact table: What was found → what it reveals about life.\nActivity 7 (20 min): Research volcanoes on other planets/moons via provided website. Use Justification Flow Chart to argue which world has the most interesting volcanoes, using “because.”\n\nEVALUATE\n- Informal assessment: responses in Activity 5 table and causal sentences.\n- Whole-class revisit of focus question; address lingering misconceptions.\n\n5. DIFFERENTIATION\n- Green Circle (core): Activities 1–5 focus on scaffolded discovery, modelling & eBook reading.\n- Blue Square (deeper): Activity 6 Pompeii analysis requires interpretive thinking.\n- Black Diamond (challenging): Activity 7 cross-planet comparison & justification.\n- Sentence starters & word banks for EAL/low literacy learners.\n- Extension: write a short report comparing two volcanic landscapes using diagrams.\n\n6. PRACTICAL TIPS\n- Prepare trays & materials in advance; cover tables for easy cleanup.\n- Group size of 3–4 for modelling; circulate to prompt predictions & observations.\n- Preview eBook questions & vocabulary with struggling readers.\n- Allow extra time/alternative tools for students with motor challenges.\n- Encourage use of labelled diagrams when writing explanations.",
