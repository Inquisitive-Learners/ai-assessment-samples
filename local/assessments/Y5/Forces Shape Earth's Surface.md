|--:|-------------------|------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | A, C              | ST3-EES-01 | Acid rain & rust are *chemical* weathering           |
| 2 | C                 | ST3-EES-01 | Students often confuse glacial valleys (B)           |
| 3 | Desert-dune photo | ST3-EES-01 | Waterfall frequently selected incorrectly             |
| 5 | B                 | ST3-SCI-02 | Weight alone (C) does not stop erosion               |
| 7 | C                 | ST3-SCI-02 | Option A & D show force misconceptions               |

## 5. Model Answers – Short-Answer

| Q | Marks | Sample response (concise)                                                  |
|--:|------:|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 4 | 1     | *Erosion is the movement of weathered rock or soil by wind, water, ice or gravity.* |
| 6 | 1     | *Land clearing removes roots that hold soil, so rain washes it away.*      |
| 8 | 2     | *Beach: Waves erode sand – sea walls slow waves. Wind blows sand – dune-grass traps it.* |
|12 | 1     | *Cool burns protect soil, encourage new growth and prevent severe fires that cause heavy erosion.* |
|14 | 2     | *Knowing the 14 m peak lets engineers build levees higher than past floods. Data also show vegetation slows water so replanting reduces damage.* |
|15 | 2     | (Diagram) → *When sedimentary rock is buried deeply and heated, it becomes metamorphic rock because pressure rearranges its minerals.* |
