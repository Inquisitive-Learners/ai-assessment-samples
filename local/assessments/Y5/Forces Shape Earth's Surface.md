Faster water has more kinetic energy, so it can pick up and transport larger amounts of sediment, increasing erosion.","isCorrect":true,"explanation":""}],"rubric":"3 marks – links speed, energy and increased sediment movement.\n2 marks – mentions speed and increased erosion but not why.\n1 mark – identifies faster water erodes more without explanation.\n0 marks – incorrect."},{"id":"Q10","type":"multiple-choice","marks":1,"question":"Volcanic eruptions can be described as","answers":[{"id":"A","content":"only destructive processes that remove land.","isCorrect":false,"explanation":""},{"id":"B","content":"both destructive and constructive processes that change
