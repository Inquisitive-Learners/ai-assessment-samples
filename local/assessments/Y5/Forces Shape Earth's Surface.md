## TEACHER KEY & MARKING GUIDE

### Multiple-Choice Answer Key
| Q | Answer |
|---|--------|
| 1 | A, C |
| 2 | C |
| 3 | Spiral-galaxy image |
| 5 | C |
| 7 | B |
| 9 | A, C |
|10 | A, C |
|11 | B, D |
|13 | B |

### Short-Answer Model Responses & Marks
* **Q4 (1)** – *A nebula is a cloud of gas and dust where stars are born.*  
* **Q6 (1)** – Any valid pairing of challenge + tech solution (e.g., *no oxygen → space suit supplies air*).  
* **Q8 (2)** – 1 mark: clear description of adjusted activity; 1 mark: accurate reason (microgravity, etc.).  
* **Q12 (1)** – *Star maps guide travel and signal seasonal change, helping people understand Country.*  
* **Q14 (2)** – 1 mark: explains confirmation/insight (e.g., *proved event-horizon theory*); 1 mark: accurate fact from unit (e.g., glowing ring).  
* **Q15 (2)** – 1 mark: states discovery (e.g., *exoplanet in Goldilocks zone*); 1 mark: explains telescope role; labelled diagram acceptable.

### Common Misconceptions
* Students may think planets give off light (they reflect it).  
* Bright nebula images are often mistaken for galaxies.  
* Some believe space suits only keep astronauts warm.  
* Deep-sea suits & mountain bikes are frequently guessed as space spin-offs.

### Allocation of Marks by Outcome
* **ST3-SCI-01** – 11 marks  
* **ST3-DAT-01** – 6 marks  
* **ST3-PQU-01** – 2 marks  
* **ST3-CWT-01** – 1 mark  

### Suggested Grade Cut-offs
* A: 17–20  
* B: 14–16
