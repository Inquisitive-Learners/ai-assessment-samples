## Answer Key

### Multiple-Choice (1 mark each)  
Q1: A & C  
Q2: C  
Q3: Spiral galaxy  
Q4: Colourful gas cloud  
Q5: C  
Q6: B  
Q7: A & C  
Q8: A & C  
Q9: B & D  
Q10: B  

### Short-Answer  
- **Q11 (1 mark):** A nebula is a cloud of gas and dust where stars form; it is important as a stellar nursery.  
- **Q12 (1 mark):** e.g. Lack of air → space suits supply oxygen; Extreme cold → insulated suits keep astronauts warm.  
- **Q13 (2 marks):** e.g. Brushing teeth uses no-rinse toothpaste because water floats; astronauts swallow or spit into a cloth.  
- **Q14 (1 mark):** They guide travel and signal seasonal events for hunting or gathering.  
- **Q15 (2 marks):** e.g. Discovery: Exoplanets in the Goldilocks Zone. Diagram: labelled mirror (primary), lens, light path, detector.
