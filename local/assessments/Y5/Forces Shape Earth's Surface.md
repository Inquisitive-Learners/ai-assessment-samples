A rapid change that can reshape land in minutes is …  
A. Glacier movement B. Earthquake C. Soil formation D. Root growth  
> **Answer:** B

**Q3** (1 mark, Short-answer)  
State one slow change *and* one fast change that can both create a new hill.  
> *Model:* Slow – sediment build-up by wind. Fast – volcanic eruption.

### 2. Water, wind and ice shape landforms  
(ST2-PFA-01 — 4 marks)

**Q4** (1 mark, MC)  
What force pulls rainwater downhill, causing rivers to erode valleys?  
A. Magnetism B. Friction C. Gravity D. Electricity  
> **Answer:** C

**Q5** (1 mark, Short-answer)  
Explain why beaches often have finer sand near the water and coarser sand higher up.  
> *Model:* Waves carry small, light grains further; heavier grains settle higher.

**Q6** (1 mark, MC)  
Glaciers reshape valleys mainly by …  
A. Melting quickly B. Scraping and plucking rock as they move C. Dropping volcanic ash D. Root wedging  
> **Answer:** B

**Q7** (1 mark, MC)  
Wind carrying sand that scratches rocks is an example of …  
A. Chemical weathering B. Biological weathering C. Physical weathering D. Deposition  
> **Answer:** C

---

### 3. Human actions & technologies that reduce erosion  
(ST2-ESE-01, ST2-DAT-01 — 3 marks)

**Q8** (1 mark, MC)  
Planting trees on a steep slope mainly helps by …  
A. Adding extra water B. Holding soil with roots C. Heating the ground D. Breaking rocks faster  
> **Answer:** B

**Q9** (2 marks, Short-answer)  
Choose one erosion-control method used near rivers. Describe **how it works** and **why it helps people**.  
> *Model:* Gabion cages absorb river energy, stop bank collapse and protect roads/homes.

---

### 4. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander knowledge  
(ST2-ESE-01 — 3 marks)

**Q10** (2 marks, MC – select 2)  
Which statements correctly describe Aboriginal understandings of landscape change?  
A. Stories connect landforms to ancestral beings  
B. Only Western science explains erosion  
C. Seasonal fire management can prevent soil loss  
D. Rock art replaces the need for navigation  
> **Answer:** A & C

**Q11** (1 mark, Short-answer)  
Why is sharing local knowledge about a river important when planning a bridge?  
> *Model:* It warns engineers where floods and bank erosion happen, making the bridge safer.

---

### 5. Nominalisation in science writing  
(ST2-CWT-01 — 1 mark)

**Q12** (1 mark, MC)  
Choose the sentence with effective nominalisation.  
A. Waves crash and wear away rocks.  
B. The constant crashing of waves causes rock erosion.  
C. Rocks get bashed by waves.  
D. Wow! Those waves really smash rocks!  
> **Answer:** B

---

### 6. Use data to support explanations  
(ST2-DAT-01 — 2 marks)

**Q13** (2 marks, Short-answer + data)  

| Site | River speed (m s⁻¹) |
|------|--------------------|
| Upper stream | 2.0 |
| Middle | 1.0 |
| Mouth | 0.5 |

a) At which site will the largest rocks most likely settle? (½ mark)  
b) Explain using the data why. (1½ marks)  

> *Model:*  
> a) Mouth.  
> b) The slowest speed (0.5 m s⁻¹) has least energy, so heavier particles drop first.

---

### 7. Diagram + compound / complex sentence  
(ST2-CWT-01, ST2-PFA-01 — 2 marks)

**Q14** (2 marks)  
Draw a cliff being weathered by sea waves. Label at least **two** features and describe the process in **one** compound or complex sentence.  

> *Model sentence:* “As powerful waves strike the base of the cliff, they carve a wave-cut notch, and the overhanging rock eventually collapses to form a retreating shoreline.”

## Section B – Extended Response (10 marks)

| # | Item | Marks |
|---|------|-------|
| **ER1** | Slow vs fast Earth changes | 4 |
| **ER2** | Evidence-based argument (soil erosion) | 3 |
| **ER3** | Multimodal explanation (river flow diagram) | 3 |

---

### ER1 – Slow vs Fast Earth Changes (4 marks)

*Marking guide*  
1 – defines weathering  
1 – defines erosion  
1 – defines deposition  
1 – links each to a named local landform with clear explanation

In some farming regions, topsoil is being lost quickly. Propose **two strategies** farmers can use to reduce soil erosion and **support each strategy** with a scientific reason or data example.  

*Marking guide*  
1½ marks per strategy: description (½) + science/data reasoning (1)

---

### ER3 – Multimodal Explanation (3 marks)

1 – accurate sediment size trend  
1 – complex explanatory sentence
