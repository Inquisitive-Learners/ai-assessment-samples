## 7. Add authority with data (2 marks)

14. **Q14** (2 marks, Short Answer)  
    In an experiment, a metal rod rose from 20 °C to 80 °C in 2 minutes, while a wooden rod rose to only 35 °C in the same time. Explain using these data why metal conducts heat faster than wood.  
    **Model answer (2 marks):**  
    The metal rod’s temperature increased by 60 °C, compared to the wood’s 15 °C, showing metal transfers heat more efficiently.
