## Content Points

1. **Forms of Energy**  
   - Light, heat (thermal), sound, electrical and chemical energy  
   - Energy transformations (e.g., light → chemical in photosynthesis; electrical → sound in speakers)  

2. **Sources and Transfer of Energy**  
   - The Sun as Earth’s primary energy source  
   - Modes of energy transfer: radiation, conduction, convection  

3. **Effects of Energy on Living Things**  
   - Photosynthesis: how plants use light energy to grow  
   - Temperature regulation in animals (e.g., behavioral adaptations to heat/cold)  

4. **Effects of Energy on Physical Systems**  
   - Heating and cooling of materials (expansion, melting, evaporation)  
   - Energy’s role in motion (e.g., wind formation, simple machines)  

5. **The Solar System**  
   - Components: Sun, planets, moons, asteroids, comets  
   - Earth’s orbit and rotation: day/night cycle, seasons  

6. **Effects of Solar Energy on Geological Systems**  
   - Weathering and erosion driven by thermal expansion and contraction  
   - The water cycle: evaporation (solar heating), condensation, precipitation  

7. **Scientific Investigation Skills**  
   - Posing testable questions about energy’s effects  
   - Designing fair tests and predicting outcomes  
   - Collecting, representing and interpreting data related to energy transfers
