Stage 2 Science – Summative Assessment  
Unit: “Processes that Shape Earth’s Surface” (Layers of the Earth, Earthquakes, Volcanoes, Weathering & Erosion)

Outcomes assessed  
• ST2-PQU-01  
• ST2-SCI-01  

Instructions  
Answer all questions in the spaces provided. Use Tier 2 and Tier 3 scientific vocabulary where appropriate, write in full sentences unless a different format is requested, and label all diagrams carefully.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Section A – Multiple-choice (1 mark each)  
Circle the correct letter.

1 . Which statement best describes Earth’s inner core?  
   a ) A thin, cool layer of solid rock  
   b ) A semi-solid layer where convection currents occur  
   c ) A solid sphere of iron and nickel kept solid by immense pressure  
   d ) A liquid layer that causes Earth’s magnetic field  

2 . What immediate effect does the force of gravity have on lava during a volcanic eruption?  
   a ) It pushes lava upward out of the vent.  
   b ) It pulls lava downhill across the landscape.  
   c ) It cools the lava quickly.  
   d ) It turns lava into magma.

3 . Earthquakes most commonly occur  
   a ) in the centre of tectonic plates.  
   b ) where tectonic plates stick and suddenly slip.  
   c ) only near volcanoes.  
   d ) when weathering weakens rocks.

4 . When moving water drops the rocks, soil and sand it was carrying, the process is called  
   a ) weathering  
   b ) deposition  
   c ) melting  
   d ) convection

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Section B – Short-answer (2–4 marks each)

5 . Label the diagram of Earth (at right) with the words crust, mantle, outer core, inner core.  
   Then describe the state (solid, liquid or semi-solid) of each layer. (4 marks)

6 . “The force of wind, water and living things can weather rocks.”  
   a ) Give one example of weathering caused by wind.  
   b ) Give one example of weathering caused by moving water.  
   c ) Explain how plant roots can act as an agent of weathering. (3 marks)

7 . Describe two ways a volcanic eruption can change a landscape and give one knock-on effect for each change. Use a causal connective in each sentence. (4 marks)

8 . During the Mars-bar model you created in class, what happened to the “crust” when the two “tectonic plates” were pushed together? Explain how this models the effect of an earthquake on real rock layers. (3 marks)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Section C – Investigating & Fair Testing (ST2-PQU-01)

9 . You carried out an investigation to answer the question:  
   “Does the force of water cause more erosion when it flows down a steeper slope?”  

   a ) Identify:  
      • the independent variable (what you changed)  
      • one controlled variable (what you kept the same). (2 marks)

   b ) State your prediction BEFORE the test. Use the word “because”. (1 mark)

   c ) Summarise your result. Refer to the amount of sand moved in each tray. (2 marks)

   d ) Write a conclusion that answers the investigation question. Begin with “The results show that…”. (2 marks)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Section D – Extended response (6 marks)

10 . Explain how the processes of weathering, erosion and deposition work together to form new landforms over time. In your explanation:  
    • define each process,  
    • identify at least one natural force that drives each process,  
    • describe a real Australian landform or landscape example that illustrates the three processes acting together.  
    Write 2–3 connected paragraphs using compound and complex sentences and appropriate Tier 3 vocabulary.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Section E – Diagram construction (4 marks)

11 . Construct a labelled flow chart that models the energy transfer and force changes that occur from:  
    magma in a magma chamber → volcanic eruption → lava flow → new rock formation.  
    Include at least four labelled boxes and two arrows showing cause-and-effect relationships (use terms such as pressure, thermal energy, force, cooling).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Section F – Reflection / Question-posing (2 marks)

12 . After completing this unit you are curious about how earthquakes might trigger landslides.  
    Pose one scientific question that could be investigated with a fair test, and describe in one sentence how you might model this in the classroom.
