## 3. Outcome Alignment

• **ST2-SCI-02** – A student describes how contact and non-contact forces affect an object’s motion.  
• **ST2-PQU-01** – A student investigates the effect of changing variables on fair tests.

All questions map directly to the descriptors above, ensuring syllabus coverage and cognitive progression from knowledge to application.
