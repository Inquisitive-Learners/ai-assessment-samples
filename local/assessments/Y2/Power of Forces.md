## ‚úÖ Answer key & mark allocation

| Q | Answer(s) | Marks |
|---|-----------|------:|
| 1 | C | 1 |
| 2 | B | 1 |

| 7 | A, B | 2 |
| 8 | A, B | 2 |
| 9 | A, C | 2 |
|10 | B | 2 |
|11 | Any valid simple machine (e.g., wheel-and-axle, lever, pulley, screw, wedge, inclined plane) | 1 |
|12 | Friction slows or stops motion by acting opposite the direction of movement | 1 |
|13 | E.g., place a metre ruler from the start line and record the distance reached by the car‚Äôs front | 1 |
|14 | Wax reduces friction between skis and snow so the skier can move faster | 1 |
|15 | Wheels change sliding friction to lower rolling friction, so less force is needed | 1 |
