### 3. Short-answer (1 mark each)

11. **Name one bone that protects internal organs.**  
    _Sample answer: Skull, ribs or pelvis._

12. **Explain briefly how muscles and bones work together to move your arm.**  
    _Sample answer: A contracting muscle pulls on its attached bone, acting like a lever to move the arm._

13. **You are testing if different shoe types affect running speed. State one variable you would keep the same to make the test fair.**

14. **Give one reason insects can move quickly even though they have no internal bones.**  
    _Sample answer: Their lightweight exoskeleton with jointed legs allows rapid movement._

15. **Why is a hinge joint suitable for the knee?**  
    _Sample answer: It allows bending in one direction, supporting walking, running and standing._
