### 1. Recognise stars, galaxies, nebulae, exoplanets and black holes as astronomical features that exist beyond our solar system

<sub>(ST3‑SCI‑01 — 6 marks)</sub>

**Q1 (1 mark, Multiple Choice)**  
_What is a galaxy?_

- [ ] A. A single star
- [ ] B. A group of planets
- [ ] C. A massive collection of stars, gas, and dust
- [ ] D. A large rock in space

> **Correct answer:** C

**Q2 (1 mark, Multiple Choice)**  
_Which image shows a nebula?_

_Image options: star cluster, exoplanet, nebula, black hole_

> **Correct answer:** Nebula image

**Q3 (2 marks, Short Answer)**  
_Explain what a black hole is and why it is unique._

> **Model answer:** A black hole is where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape. It is unique because it warps space and time.
