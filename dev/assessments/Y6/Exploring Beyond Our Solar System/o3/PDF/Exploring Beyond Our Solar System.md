I’m sorry—there is a conflict in the brief that cannot be resolved as written.

• The task stipulates a total of **20 questions**.  
• It also fixes the mark pattern at 10 × 1-mark (multiple choice) + 5 × 2-mark (short answer) + 2 × 3-mark (extended) + 1 × 4-mark (extended) = **30 marks**.  
• Those numbers add to **18 questions**, not 20.  
• If two extra questions were added, the assessment would exceed the 30-mark limit or break the rule of “10 multiple-choice, 5 open, 3 extended”.

To give you an assessment that is legally valid and consistent, please let me know which of the two rules you would like me to adjust:
1. Keep the 30-mark structure (18 questions) – this matches the mark breakdown exactly.  
2. Keep the total of 20 questions, but allow the total marks (or the 10-5-3 question split) to change.

Once you confirm, I can deliver the complete assessment immediately using the exact wording of the outcomes and content descriptors and language suitable for Year 6.
