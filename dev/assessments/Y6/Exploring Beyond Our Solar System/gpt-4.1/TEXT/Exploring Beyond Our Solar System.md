### Short-Answer Marking: Model Answers

4.  
**Model answer:**
• Stars give off their own light; planets reflect light from a star (1 mark).
• Stars twinkle; planets do not twinkle but move in a path across the sky (1 mark).  
(Must include how to tell apart.)

7.  
**Model answer:**  
• No air in space – astronauts use oxygen tanks. (1)  
• Muscles get weak in microgravity – astronauts do special exercise. (1)

9.  
**Model answer:**  
• Eating: Food needs to be sticky or squeezed from a tube, so it doesn’t float away.  
• Sleeping: Astronauts sleep in sleeping bags attached to the wall so they do not float (1 mark for activity, 1 for correct “why”).

12.  
**Model answer:**  
• GPS: Used for satellite navigation in space; on Earth, lets people use map apps for directions.  
• Memory foam: Invented for space, now used in mattresses to make them more comfortable.

15.  
**Model answer:**  
• Discovery: The first image of a black hole (2019) was made possible by using global radio telescopes working together. This proved that black holes are real, not just in theory.

17.  
**Model answer:**  
• Aboriginal Peoples use the Sun to show east (rises) and west (sets) for direction.  
• They use the Moon’s different phases for safe travel at night or to know tides for fishing.
