| 4   | A black hole is a place in space with very strong gravity. Not even light can escape it. Scientists want to learn more because they show how gravity works.         | 2     | ST3‑SCI‑01      | Recognise stars, galaxies, nebulae, exoplanets and black holes as astronomical features that exist beyond our solar system               | Understanding       |
| 5   | Example: Galaxy—1. Has billions of stars. 2. Our solar system is in the Milky Way galaxy. Galaxies help us learn about the universe’s size and how stars move.| 2     | ST3‑SCI‑01      | Recognise stars, galaxies, nebulae, exoplanets and black holes as astronomical features that exist beyond our solar system               | Understanding       |
| 8   | Example: Eating—astronauts eat food in pouches, not plates, so it doesn’t float away. Brushing teeth—they swallow paste, not spit, because water floats.            | 2     | ST3‑SCI‑01      | Research how living things can travel and survive in space                                   | Understanding       |
| 9   | Example: 1. Space suits give astronauts oxygen to breathe. 2. Spaceships recycle water so astronauts always have something to drink.                                | 2     | ST3‑SCI‑01      | Research how living things can travel and survive in space                                   | Understanding       |

| 14  | Example: The Hubble Telescope helped scientists discover galaxies outside our own and take clear pictures of them.                                                  | 2     | ST3‑DAT‑01      | Examine the development of our knowledge through discoveries and technologies, and how these benefit humankind | Understanding       |
| 15  | Scientists used special telescopes to take a photo of a black hole. The image matched what Einstein’s theory predicted, showing the “shadow” ring, which proved black holes are real.| 3 | ST3‑DAT‑01      | Add authority to written texts by using data to support an evidence-based explanation or argument | Understanding/Skills|
| 18  | Example: The phases of the Moon help Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples know when tides are high, which is important for fishing or travel.              | 2     | ST3‑SCI‑01      | Describe how Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander Peoples' Knowledges of the positions of the Sun, Moon and stars are used for navigation and wayfinding | Understanding |
| 19  | Example: The Emu in the Sky helps the Kamilaroi know when to collect eggs and move across land. This knowledge supports safe travel and caring for Country.         | 3     | ST3‑SCI‑01      | Describe how Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander Peoples' Knowledges of the positions of the Sun, Moon and stars are used for navigation and wayfinding | Understanding |
| 20  | Example: The rocket launch begins when fuel burns and builds up pressure. The launch allows the rocket to escape Earth's gravity, then smaller boosters help exploration in space. Diagram: Rocket labelled with “Launch”, “Atmosphere”, “Space”, “Booster separation”.| 4 | ST3‑CWT‑01 | Use nominalisations to convey scientific and technological concepts and processes succinctly; Use compound and complex sentences and labelled diagrams to create a text that explains a process, concept or investigation | Communication Skills |
