✅ Answer Key & Marks Breakdown  

| Q | Answer(s) / Model answer | Marks | Outcome | Content Descriptor (exact) | Cognitive level | Common misconception (MC) |
|---|--------------------------|------:|---------|---------------------------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| 1 | A | 1 | ST2-SCI-01 | Identify parts of the human skeleton that offer protection and support | Knowledge | Many students choose ribs because they also protect organs |
| 2 | C | 1 | ST2-SCI-01 | Recognise that all animals are either invertebrates with no spine, or vertebrates with a spine | Knowledge | Octopus is often thought to have “soft bones” |
| 3 | B & C | 2 | ST2-SCI-01 | Identify parts of the human skeleton that offer protection and support | Knowledge | Some pick A (saliva) |
| 4 | A & C | 2 | ST2-SCI-01 | Model how bones, muscles and joints work together to cause movement | Understanding | Tricep shortens is often chosen |
| 5 | A & C | 2 | ST2-SCI-01 | Compare ways invertebrates and vertebrates move on land, in water and in the sky | Understanding | Snails wrongly thought to have tiny spines |
| 6 | B | 1 | ST2-SCI-01 | Model how bones, muscles and joints work together to cause movement | Understanding | Confusing hinge with ball-and-socket |
| 7 | B | 1 | ST2-PQU-01 | Use temporal and causal connectives and labelled diagrams when explaining the process of conducting a fair test | Scientific skills | Students think any “why” is scientific |
| 8 | A & C | 2 | ST2-SCI-01 | Use Tier 2 and Tier 3 vocabulary and noun groups to enhance the specificity of texts | Knowledge | “Tendon” is not a bone |
| 9 | B | 1 | ST2-SCI-01 | Use notes, diagrams, flow charts and annotations to support understanding and explain processes | Scientific skills | Photos show what food looks like, not the path |
| 10| A & B | 2 | ST2-PQU-01 | Use temporal and causal connectives and labelled diagrams when explaining the process of conducting a fair test | Scientific skills | Students may keep bar height different |
| 11| Spine / pelvis / femur (any one) | 1 | ST2-SCI-01 | Identify parts of the human skeleton that offer protection and support | Knowledge | — |
| 12| Example: “Muscles pull on the leg bones so the lower leg swings forward.” | 1 | ST2-SCI-01 | Recognise that the human muscular and skeletal systems work together to enable movement | Understanding | — |
| 13| Example: “Everyone uses the same limbo bar height to start.” | 1 | ST2-PQU-01 | Use temporal and causal connectives and labelled diagrams when explaining the process of conducting a fair test | Scientific skills | — |
| 14| Example: “A worm squeezes and stretches to crawl, but a fish uses a flexible spine and tail to swim.” | 1 | ST2-SCI-01 | Compare ways invertebrates and vertebrates move on land, in water and in the sky | Understanding | — |
| 15| Example: “My heart beats faster when I run because my muscles need more oxygen.” | 1 | ST2-SCI-01 | Use compound and complex sentences to sequence connected ideas into paragraphs when explaining cause and effect | Scientific skills | — |
