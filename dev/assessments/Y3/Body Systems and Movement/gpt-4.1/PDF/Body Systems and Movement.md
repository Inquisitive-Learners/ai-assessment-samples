| 14  | e.g. "Vertebrates use bones and muscles, like a dog running; invertebrates slither or crawl, like a worm."|   2   | ST2-SCI-01     | Compare ways invertebrates and vertebrates move on land, in water and in the sky                                           | Understanding       | 1 mark each: vertebrate and invertebrate      |
