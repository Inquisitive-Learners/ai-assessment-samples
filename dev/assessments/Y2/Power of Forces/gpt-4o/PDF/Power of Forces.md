### ✍️ Short‑Answer (2 marks each)

**Q10** – _Explain how friction affects a sliding object._

> **Model answer:** Friction slows down the object. For example, an object slides slower on carpet than on smooth tile because carpet has more friction.  
> **Marks:** 1 for stating the effect, 1 for providing an example

---

**Q11** – _Describe how to test if something is magnetic._

> **Model answer:** Use a magnet to see if it sticks to the object. If it does, the object is magnetic.  
> **Marks:** 1 for mentioning use of a magnet, 1 for stating the result

---

**Q12** – _Design a simple test to see if friction is different on surfaces._

> **Model answer:** Roll a toy car on carpet, tile, and sandpaper. See how far it goes each time. Write down what happens.  
> **Marks:** 1 for outlining the test, 1 for stating the measurement method
