### ‚úçÔ∏è Short-Answer (2 marks each)

**Q10**  (Understanding)  
Explain how twisting a spinning top makes it spin. Describe which forces you apply and what effect they have on the top‚Äôs movement.  

> Model answer (2 marks):  
> ‚Ä¢ I twist the stem by pushing one way and pulling the other (1 mark),  
> ‚Ä¢ so the top spins quickly on its point (1 mark).  

**Q11**  (Scientific skills)  
Describe how you would test how different surfaces affect the distance a toy car travels. Include:  
- the surfaces you would use,  
- how you would apply the push,  
- and how you would record the distances.  

> Model answer (2 marks):  
> ‚Ä¢ I would push the car with the same strength on tile, carpet and sandpaper (1 mark),  
> ‚Ä¢ measure each travel distance and record them in a table (1 mark).  

**Q12**  (Understanding)  
Write one compound sentence using the word ‚Äúso‚Äù to describe the cause-and-effect relationship between push strength and how far the toy car travels.  

> Model answer (2 marks):  
> ‚ÄúI pushed the car hard, so it rolled farther than when I pushed it gently.‚Äù
