## ‚úÖ Answer Key & Marks Breakdown

| Q | Answer / Model answer | Marks | Outcome | **Content Descriptor** | Cognitive level | Common misconceptions (MC only) |
|---|-----------------------|:----:|---------|------------------------|-----------------|----------------------------------|
| 1 | B (push image) | 1 | ST1-SCI-01 | Recognise that a force is a push or a pull that can make things either start moving, stop moving, change speed, direction or shape | Knowledge | Choosing A: students mix up pull vs push |
| 2 | C | 1 | ST1-SCI-01 | Recognise that a force is a push or a pull that can make things either start moving, stop moving, change speed, direction or shape | Knowledge | Option D confuses mass with force |
| 3 | B | 1 | ST1-PQU-01 | Pose questions and test the effects of forces on an object's movement | Scientific skills | A & C are opinion questions |
| 4 | A | 1 | ST1-PQU-01 | Pose questions and test the effects of forces on an object's movement | Scientific skills | Some pick C, thinking surface is same as height variable |
| 5 | C | 1 | ST1-SCI-01 | Investigate how applied forces change the movement of traditional toys and tools used by Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander Peoples | Knowledge | Message sticks (A) are often passed not thrown far |
| 6 | B | 1 | ST1-SCI-01 | Investigate how applied forces change the movement of traditional toys and tools used by Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander Peoples | Understanding | Students may think friction starts motion |
| 7 | C | 1 | ST1-SCI-01 | Test how frictional forces affect moving objects | Knowledge | Ice looks slippery so some choose B for least friction |
| 8 | C | 1 | ST1-SCI-01 | Test how the force of magnetism affects objects | Knowledge | Painted wood can mislead |
| 9 | B | 1 | ST1-SCI-01 | Test how the force of magnetism affects objects | Knowledge | Many believe ‚Äúlikes attract‚Äù |
| 10 | Grass is rough ‚Üí **more friction** slows the ball (1); Ice is smooth ‚Üí **less friction** so ball slides longer (1) | 2 | ST1-SCI-01 | Test how frictional forces affect moving objects | Understanding | ‚Äî |
| 11 | Magnet pulls metal clip through plate (1); Magnetism works **without touching**, so clip follows (1) | 2 | ST1-SCI-01 | Test how the force of magnetism affects objects | Understanding | ‚Äî |
| 12 | Example: keep **same marble & ramp length** (1); change **surface** (1); measure **distance rolled** (1) | 2 | ST1-PQU-01 | Pose questions and test the effects of forces on an object's movement | Scientific skills | ‚Äî |
