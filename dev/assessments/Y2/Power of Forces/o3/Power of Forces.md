### Suggested Model Responses for Short-Answer

11. Skull (or ribcage, pelvis)  
12. Muscles work in pairs: as one contracts (shortens) the opposite muscle relaxes, pulling the bone.  
13. Keep the surface the same / have all students jump from the same starting line / keep technique identical.  
14. A hard outer shell protects soft tissues and supports the insect’s body.  
15. It has no rigid skeleton, so its soft body can bend and squeeze through tight spaces.
