|11 | Any valid: ribs / skull / vertebrae … | 1 | ST2-SCI-01 | Protection bones | Recall |
|12 | Tendons attach muscles to bones; when a muscle contracts it pulls on the tendon, moving the bone. | 1 | ST2-SCI-01 | Systems interaction | Explain |
|13 | Any suitable control variable (e.g. same surface, same footwear, same measuring tool). | 1 | ST2-PQU-01 | Fair testing | Apply |
|14 | Earthworm contracts body muscles in waves (peristalsis) and uses bristles to grip soil. | 1 | ST2-SCI-01 | Movement without skeleton | Explain |
|15 | Microgravity removes weight-bearing stress, so less calcium is kept and bones weaken. | 1 | ST2-SCI-01 | Bone health | Explain |
