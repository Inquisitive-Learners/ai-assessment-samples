| 13  | Change: slope steepness. Keep same: amount of water (could also be sand or tray size)                                         | 2     | ST2‚ÄëPQU‚Äë01  | Poses questions to create fair tests that investigate the effects of energy on living things and physical systems | Scientific Skills  | Students mix up variable changed vs held constant      |
| 14  | Example: River made by the Super Snake in Dreaming story, explains snake movement forms river                                 | 2     | ST2‚ÄëSCI‚Äë01  | Investigate Aboriginal Dreaming Stories and Torres Strait Islander Legends about the formation of landscapes and landforms | Understanding      | Must reference BOTH the landform & the story           |
| 15  | Erosion/weathering by water makes rocks rub together and wear down to become smooth                                           | 2     | ST2‚ÄëSCI‚Äë01  | Explain how the forces produced by wind, water and living things weather rocks | Knowledge          | Avoid ‚Äúrivers make rocks smooth‚Äù w/out explanation     |
