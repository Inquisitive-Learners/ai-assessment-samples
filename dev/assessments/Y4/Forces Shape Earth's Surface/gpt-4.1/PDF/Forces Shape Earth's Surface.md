| Q | Answer(s) | Marks | Outcome | Content Descriptor | Cognitive Level | Common Misconceptions |
|---|-----------|-------|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| 1 | C | 1 | ST2-SCI-01 | Research, describe and model the internal structure of Earth | Knowledge | "Mantle" is sometimes chosen for outer layer |
| 2 | B (surface: land, rocks, water) | 1 | ST2-SCI-01 | Research, describe and model the internal structure of Earth | Knowledge | Surface confused with sky or inside Earth |
| 3 | A | 1 | ST2-SCI-01 | Research and describe the changes to the landscape caused by earthquakes and volcanoes | Knowledge | Eruption or rain confused as earthquake |
