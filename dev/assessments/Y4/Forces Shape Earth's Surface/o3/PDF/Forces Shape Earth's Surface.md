A A chain of sand islands B A winding river C A tall volcano D A deep trench  

---

**Q2 – Dreaming stories**  
Dreaming stories help science learning because they:  
A always replace experiments B tell how machines work C give cultural ideas we can compare with natural forces D only talk about stars  

---

**Q3 – Earth’s layers**  
Which cross-section shows Earth’s layers from the outside to the centre in the **correct** order? (Teacher shows four labelled diagrams; students choose A, B, C or D.)

---

**Q4 – Earth’s layers**  
Most volcanic eruptions happen because hot rock moves in the:  
A Inner core B Mantle C Atmosphere D Crust only  

---

**Q5 – Weathering**  
Which picture shows weathering by **living things**?  
A Tree roots splitting a rock B Waves crashing on a cliff C Sand blasting a rock D Ice cracking a boulder  

---

**Q6 – Weathering**  
Wind makes a desert rock arch smoother over time because wind-blown sand:  
A melts the surface B scratches and chips tiny grains away C glues grains together D cools the rock quickly  

---

**Q7 – Earthquakes & volcanoes**  
An earthquake usually happens when:  
A Tectonic plates suddenly slide past each other  
B Ocean tides rise  
C Volcanoes cool down  
D Large animals stamp on the ground  

---

**Q8 – Earthquakes & volcanoes**  
After a big volcanic eruption, which change is most likely?  
A A new island forms from cooled lava  
B A glacier forms in one night  
C Sand dunes grow taller  
D A river suddenly dries up  

---

**Q9 – Moving-water erosion**  
Look at the diagram of a river bend. At which point (P, Q, R or S) will **erosion** be strongest? (Outer bank is labelled Q.)

---

**Q10 – Tier 3 vocabulary**  
Choose the best Tier 3 word to finish the sentence.  
“Rapid ___ along the fault raised the ground.”  
A movement B shaking C displacement D bump  

---

### ✍️ Short-Answer (2 marks each)

**Q11 – Weathering (living things)**  
Name **two** ways plants or animals can weather rock **and** explain why each way breaks the rock.  

---

**Q12 – Fair-test language**  
Write one compound sentence about the tray experiment with the steepest slope. Use **one temporal connective** (e.g. *after*, *when*) **and one causal connective** (e.g. *because*, *so*).  

---

**Q13 – Earthquakes & volcanoes**  
In one complex sentence, explain how earthquakes **and** volcanoes can both change Earth’s surface quickly.  

---

**Q14 – Notes & diagrams**  
Draw and label a simple diagram showing **all four layers of Earth**. Add **one short note** that links heat in the mantle to surface volcanoes.  

---

**Q15 – Dreaming story + science words**  
Choose **one** Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander landform story you have learned.  
a) Name the landform.  
b) Using clear Tier 3 words, describe one natural force that scientists say formed it.

| 4 | B | 1 | ST2-SCI-01 | Research, describe and model the internal structure of Earth | Understanding | Choose crust only |
| 5 | A | 1 | ST2-SCI-01 | Explain how the forces produced by wind, water and living things weather rocks | Knowledge | Pick waves (erosion) |
| 6 | B | 1 | ST2-SCI-01 | Explain how the forces produced by wind, water and living things weather rocks | Understanding | Think sand melts rock |
| 7 | A | 1 | ST2-SCI-01 | Research and describe the changes to the landscape caused by earthquakes and volcanoes | Knowledge | Select tides cause quakes |
| 8 | A | 1 | ST2-SCI-01 | Research and describe the changes to the landscape caused by earthquakes and volcanoes | Understanding | Choose glacier option |
