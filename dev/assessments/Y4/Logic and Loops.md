### ✍️ Short‑Answer (2 marks each)

**Q10** – _Explain how a "repeat until" loop can be used in a real-life scenario._

> **Model answer:** A "repeat until" loop in a game can keep running until a player reaches a goal, ensuring continuous gameplay.

---

**Q11** – _Describe how branching could be used to make a decision in cooking._

> **Model answer:** Use branching to decide whether to add salt if a soup tastes bland; otherwise, continue cooking.

---

**Q12** – _How do "repeat" blocks make coding more efficient?_

> **Model answer:** They reduce the need for repeating code lines by automatically repeating a block of code several times.

---

**Q13** – _Design a simple user interface feature for a weather app and describe its purpose._

> **Model answer:** A simple button to refresh the weather data to ensure users have the latest forecasts.

---

**Q14** – _Discuss how a user story could improve an educational app._
