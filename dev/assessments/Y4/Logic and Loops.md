### ✍️ Short‑Answer (2 marks each)

**Q11** – _Describe how a "repeat until" loop works with an example._

> **Model answer:** A "repeat until" loop continues until a specific condition is met. Example: A robot vacuum cleans until the floor is clean.  
> **Marks breakdown:** 1 for explanation, 1 for example

**Q12** – _Explain the role of algorithms in solving complex tasks with an example._

> **Model answer:** Algorithms break tasks into clear, manageable steps, simplifying complex tasks. Example: Recipe steps ensure a cake bakes correctly.  
> **Marks breakdown:** 1 for role explanation, 1 for example

**Q13** – _Create and describe a simple algorithm using if blocks._

> **Model answer:** Start > Check if light is red > If yes, stop > If no, move. This adds decision-making to algorithms.  
> **Marks breakdown:** 1 for algorithm design, 1 for description

**Q14** – _How does looping in coding optimize tasks? Provide an example._

> **Model answer:** Loops reduce code repetition and streamline processes. Example: A loop prints numbers 1 to 10 efficiently.
