**Q5**  
_How does a branching statement help?_

- [ ] A. It stops everything
- [ ] B. It repeats actions
- [ ] C. It helps make choices
- [ ] D. It starts again

> **Correct answer:** C

#### Openâ€‘Answer (2â€¯marksâ€¯each)

**Q6** â€“ _Why are loops helpful in coding?_

> **Model answer:** Loops let you do the same action many times without repeating the code, making it shorter and easier to read.

**Q7** â€“ _Write a simple plan using a 'repeat until' loop to turn on a light until itâ€™s bright outside._

> **Model answer:** 
1. Check if itâ€™s bright.
2. If not bright, keep the light on.
3. Repeat until it is bright.
   - **Mark breakdown:** 1 mark for plan structure, 1 mark for logical steps.

**Q8** â€“ _Give an example of when you might use a branching decision._

> **Model answer:** Deciding if a username and password are correct before logging in.

**Q9** â€“ _What does an 'if' statement do in a program?_

> **Model answer:** It checks if something is true and decides what happens next in the program.

**Q10** â€“ _How do block coding and writing code look different for loops?_

> **Model answer:** Block coding uses pictures and blocks, while writing code uses words and symbols.
