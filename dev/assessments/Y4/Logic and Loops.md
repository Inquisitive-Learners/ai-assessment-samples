### ✍️ Short‑Answer (2 marks each)

**Q11**  
_How can an algorithm help you solve problems?_

> **Model answer:** An algorithm breaks a big problem into smaller steps, making it easier to solve.  
> **(1 mark for breaking down, 1 mark for solving easier)**

---

**Q12**  
_What role do "if" blocks play in decisions in code?_

> **Model answer:** "If" blocks check conditions and decide what happens based on whether the condition is true or false.  
> **(1 mark for checking conditions, 1 mark for decision-making)**

---

**Q13**  
_Describe a time you could use a "Repeat until" block outside the computer._

> **Model answer:** Use a "Repeat until" block to keep brushing your teeth until a timer rings.  
> **(1 mark for real-world example, 1 mark for application)**

---

**Q14**  
_Why might using blocks be easier for kids who are beginning to code?_

> **Model answer:** Blocks are easier because you can drag and drop them and see how the code looks visually.  
> **(1 mark for drag-and-drop, 1 mark for visual aids)**

---

**Q15**  
_What happens when you use multiple loops inside each other (nested loops)?_

> **Model answer:** Nested loops help repeat more complicated tasks, making the code shorter and handling patterns better.  
> **(1 mark for repeating tasks, 1 mark for patterns)**
