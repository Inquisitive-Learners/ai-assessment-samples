### ✍️ Open-Answer (2 marks each)

**Q11**  
_Describe how a 'repeat until' loop is different from a regular repeat loop._

> **Model answer:** A 'repeat until' loop continues executing until a specific condition is met, unlike a regular repeat loop which executes a set number of times.  
> **Marks breakdown:**  
> 1 mark for explaining 'repeat until'  
> 1 mark for comparing with regular repeat  
> **Outcome:** AC9TDI4P02  
> **Cognitive level:** Understanding

**Q12**  
_Explain the role of branching in a simple program._

> **Model answer:** Branching allows a program to choose different paths or actions based on specific conditions or decisions.  
> **Marks breakdown:**  
> 2 marks for explaining branching  
> **Outcome:** AC9TDI4P02  
> **Cognitive level:** Understanding

**Q13**  
_Provide an example of a condition that could be used in an algorithm and explain its purpose._

> **Model answer:** An example condition is "if it is raining." Its purpose could be to decide "carry an umbrella" in a weather app.  
> **Marks breakdown:**  
> 1 mark for the condition example  
> 1 mark for explaining its purpose  
> **Outcome:** ST2-DDT-02  
> **Cognitive level:** Skills

**Q14**  
_What are two advantages of using loops in coding?_

> **Model answer:** Loops simplify repetitive tasks and reduce the amount of code needed.  
> **Marks breakdown:**  
> 1 mark for simplification  
> 1 mark for code reduction  
> **Outcome:** AC9TDI4P04  
> **Cognitive level:** Understanding

**Q15**  
_How can the ‘If’ and ‘Else’ blocks be used in a decision-making algorithm?_

> **Model answer:** The ‘If’ block runs a specific command when a condition is true. The ‘Else’ block provides alternative commands if the condition is false.  
> **Marks breakdown:**  
> 1 mark for 'If' block usage  
> 1 mark for 'Else' block usage  
> **Outcome:** AC9TDI4P02  
> **Cognitive level:** Skills
